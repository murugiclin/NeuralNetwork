ML-CPP-Core

ML-CPP-Core is a lightweight C++ library implementing fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, K-Means Clustering, and a Feedforward Neural Network. Designed for educational purposes, this repository provides clean, minimal implementations to help understand the core mechanics of these algorithms. It is ideal for students, hobbyists, and developers learning machine learning concepts in C++.

Features:

    Linear Regression: Fits a line to data using the least squares method for regression tasks.
    Decision Tree: Implements a binary classification tree with Gini impurity-based splitting.
    K-Means Clustering: Clusters data points into k groups based on Euclidean distance.
    Neural Network: A feedforward neural network with one hidden layer, trained via backpropagation (solves XOR problem as an example).
    Example usage for each algorithm included in the main program.

Getting Started

Prerequisites:

    C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later (e.g., g++, clang++)
    Standard Template Library (STL)
    No external dependencies required

Installation:

    Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/murugiclinL-CPP-Core.git</your-username>
    Navigate to the project directory: cd ML-CPP-Core
    Compile and run: g++ MachineLearning.cpp -o ml_core ./ml_core

Usage:
The main() function in MachineLearning.cpp demonstrates example usage for each algorithm:

    Linear Regression: Fits a line to sample data (e.g., y = 2x) and predicts a new value.
    Decision Tree: Classifies 2D points (e.g., binary classification on a simple dataset).
    K-Means: Clusters 2D points into two groups.
    Neural Network: Trains on the XOR problem to demonstrate non-linear classification.

To experiment, modify the main() function with your own datasets or parameters.

Code Structure:

    LinearRegression: Class implementing linear regression with fit and predict methods.
    DecisionTree: Class for binary classification with a configurable max depth.
    KMeans: Class for clustering with a configurable number of clusters.
    NeuralNetwork: Class implementing a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer, trained via backpropagation.
    All implementations are contained in MachineLearning.cpp.

Example Output:
Linear Regression: y = 2x + 0
Prediction for x=6: 12
Decision Tree prediction for [0.5, 0.5]: 0
K-Means cluster assignments: 0 0 1 1 1
Epoch 0 Error: 0.25
...
Predictions:
Input: [0, 0] Output: 0.03
Input: [0, 1] Output: 0.95
Input: [1, 0] Output: 0.94
Input: [1, 1] Output: 0.06

Notes:

    These are simplified implementations for educational purposes. They lack optimizations like batch processing, advanced regularization, or vectorized operations.
    The Decision Tree uses a basic Gini impurity criterion and does not handle continuous outputs.
    K-Means uses random centroid initialization, which may lead to varying results.
    The Neural Network is a basic feedforward model with sigmoid activation and mean squared error loss.
    For production use, consider established libraries like MLpack, Eigen, or TensorFlow (C++ API).
